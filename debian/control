Description: New FFI-based Lua API for NGINX Lua module
 This pure Lua library reimplements part of the ngx_lua module's Nginx API
 for Lua with LuaJIT FFI and installs the new FFI-based Lua API
 into the ngx.* and ndk.* namespaces used by the ngx_lua module. In addition,
 this Lua library implements any significant new Lua APIs of the ngx_lua module
 as proper Lua modules, like ngx.semaphore and ngx.balancer. The FFI-based
 Lua API can work with LuaJIT's JIT compiler. ngx_lua's default API is based on
 the standard Lua C API, which will never be JIT compiled and the user Lua code
 is always interpreted (slowly).
